# Lab 4

An associative array (or dictionary) is an abstract data type that maps input keys to output values (for example: names to telephone numbers, or words to definitions). In this assignment, you will create an associative array to store keys and values with a simple singly linked-list implementation.

You will use the following definition of a linked list node:

```
#define MAX_KEY_LEN (32)
#define MAX_VALUE_LEN (32)

struct list_data {
  char key[MAX_KEY_LEN];
  char value[MAX_VALUE_LEN];
};

struct list_node {
  struct list_data data;
  struct list_node *next;
};

struct list_node *head = NULL;
```
You have to implement the following functions for your code:

```
void list_print(struct list_node *head);
struct list_node *list_find_exact(struct list_node *head, const char *key);
struct list_node *list_find_before(struct list_node *head, const char *key);
int list_insert(struct list_node **head, struct list_node *before,
                struct list_data data);
void list_destroy(struct list_node *head);
```

The exact semantics for each function are provided in the example code, and several test files are included.

Simply typing `make` will compile your code.

Your code will output the entire list after every insertion. After inserting all of the key­value pairs There is an additional command­line argument that takes in a list of entries to search for and prints the value for each entry or an error if no entry is found.

Example run command will look like this:

```
> ./dict 1 <inputfile> <optional lookups>
```
(The 1 indicates that the data should be sorted.)

Read the code to understand the details of command line arguments. Replace `dict` with `dict_full` to run the sample executable. Note that your executable must give the exact same output as our executable. This doesn't mean that what we have is perfect, so if you believe that your results are correct and ours wrong, let us know as soon as possible.

**VERY IMPORTANT** Please read the skeleton code we gave you carefully line by line and understand it before you start coding. Most of you struggle trying to implement a functionality that is already provided to you.
